This is the playtest version for EQueue, my tabletop boardgame 
I've been developing for a while. The code is built with Phaser3
and for the multiplayer connectivity, I am using a simple 
socket-service on node.js.

Please remind that this game is in its early stages and not for
copying its mechanics bluntlessly. This prototype serves only as
the playtest ground for the main mechanics.
